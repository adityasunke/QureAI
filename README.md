# 🧬 Qure AI  
*AI + Quantum Computing for Accelerated Drug Discovery Against Meningitis*

---

## 🚀 Project Overview
**Qure AI** is a hybrid **AI + Quantum** pipeline designed to discover and validate potential drug molecules targeting the bacteria that cause **meningitis**.  

- **AI/ML Component**: A machine learning model (Support Vector Machine) is trained on molecular datasets (sourced from **ChEMBL**) to identify effective drug candidates. We also use generative AI to propose **novel SMILES strings** as potential cures.  
- **Quantum Component**: The **Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE)** algorithm is applied to calculate molecular ground-state energies. Lower energies indicate greater molecular stability, providing a validation step for both existing and AI-generated molecules.  

This project demonstrates the **synergy of machine learning and quantum simulation** for next-generation drug discovery.

## 🧠 Motivation
Meningitis remains a **critical global health burden**:  
- Every year, **236,000 people die** of meningitis.  
- Over **2 million new cases** are diagnosed annually.  
- That’s **1 death every 2 minutes** and **1 diagnosis every 15 seconds**.  
- **1 in 5 survivors** live with permanent disabilities (brain damage, limb amputations, kidney failure).  
- Within **1–2 years**, the majority of antibodies decrease rapidly.  

By integrating AI and quantum computing, **Qure AI** aims to accelerate drug discovery and validation, potentially reducing timelines and costs compared to traditional wet-lab methods.

## 🔬 Target Bacteria
We studied molecules that attack **four major bacterial pathogens** responsible for meningitis:  
- *Neisseria meningitidis*  
- *Streptococcus pneumoniae*  
- *Haemophilus influenzae*  
- *Streptococcus agalactiae*

## 🧠 Machine Learning Component
- **Model Used**: Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- **Objective**: Classify molecules as effective/ineffective against target bacteria  
- **Generative AI**: Produce **novel SMILES molecules** with drug-like properties

## ⚛️ Quantum Validation (VQE)
- **Framework**: Qiskit + PySCF  
- **Process**:  
  1. Convert molecules into Hamiltonians  
  2. Run **Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE)**  
  3. Compare ground-state energies  
- **Interpretation**:  
  - **Lower energy → more stable molecule**  
  - Validates both **existing** and **AI-generated** molecules
